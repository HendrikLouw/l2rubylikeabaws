Yukihiro Matsumoto (まつもとゆきひろ Matsumoto Yukihiro?, a.k.a. Matz, born 14 April 1965) is a Japanese computer scientist and software programmer best known as the chief designer of the Ruby programming language and its reference implementation, Matz's Ruby Interpreter (MRI).

In 1999 Hansson founded and built a Danish online gaming news website and community called Daily Rush, which he ran until 2001.[4].
After attracting the attention of Jason Fried by offering him help with php coding, Hansson was hired by Fried to build a web-based project management tool, which ultimately became 37signals' Basecamp Software as a Service product.
To aid the development process, Hansson used the then-obscure Ruby programming language to develop a custom web framework. The web framework he created was later released separately from the project management tool as the open source project Ruby On Rails. In 2005 he was recognized by Google and O'Reilly with the Hacker of the Year award for his creation of Ruby on Rails.[5]
After graduating from the Copenhagen Business School and receiving his bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Business Administration, he moved from Denmark to Chicago, Illinois, U.S. in November 2005.
